      <h2>About</h2>
  <!-- <a href="./Sketches/page2.html" target="_self"><button class="button">info</button></a> -->
  <p>The project mellow meadowlands reimagines the way one feels 
    in this messy world through abstract forms and patterns. 
    The way one interacts with their surroundings may differ due 
    to many tangible and non-tangible objects, people and situations. 
    This project is an attempt to interpret the act of “being” and 
    “living” through a body. It also 
    explores the relationship between permanance and temporality.<br><br>
    Everything we see, feel, own and love is flickering,
    fleeting and could be taken away.<br><br>
    This project was initially inspired by the work Bob Cobbing, who
    worked with concrete, visual and sound poetry. 
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
  <p>The patterns have been coded using p5.js. This site is to be 
    viewed on larger screens for the intented look. In the future, more 
    features with be added to the editor, which will allow the users to create more 
    complex patterns and compositions. 
  </p>
  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <p>The Editor allows you to creat yor own compositions using different 
    patterns. There is also a fetaure to generate text. Reset the sketch, to 
    get a blank canvas for the same set of images. However, if you refresh the 
    page, you will recieve a new set of images to play around with!
    The generator is programmed in a way in which, it generates the 
    compositions automatically along with the metadata.
